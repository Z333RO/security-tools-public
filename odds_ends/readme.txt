WARNING!! DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE PAYLOADS ON PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS!!! ONLY CTFs, LABS AND EXAMS!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

The accesschk zip file is found here: https://xor.cat/assets/other/Accesschk.zip
That's the old version that accepts eula on the command line. May need these for some CTFs. 

The VC_redist.x64.exe file is needed to run printspoofer on the target machine. Install this before running it.
